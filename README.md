# High Order Local Linearization methods

This Matlab toolbox provides the <strong>Jacobian-free High Order Local Linearization (HOLL)</strong> schemes JFLLRK and JFLLRK4 described in [1] for the integration of large systems of initial value problems.

The file `run_convergence.m` in the folder `demo` generates the Figures 1-3 and Tables 2-4 of [1] illustrating the convergence rate of the Jacobian-free HOLL scheme JFLLRK for different parameter values.

The file `run_examples.m` in the folder `demo` generates the Tables 5-8 of [1] illustrating the performance of the Jacobian-free HOLL scheme JFLLRK4 for different step-size values.
